\section{Summary}

We implemented a parallelized Tetris solver for a tetris game using various algorithms and performed a detailed analysis of the speedup and performance of the different algorithms. We  parallelized our dfs solver using OpenMP on the GHC and PSC machines, and CilkPlus on the GHC machines. Our final result reached near perfect speedup and can clear 1000 lines per second using 128 threads on the PSC machine.
